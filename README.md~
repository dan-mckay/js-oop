Dischost
=========

Dischost is an application that allows you to catalogue your music.

Features:

  - Create a catalogue of your collection
  - Upload music to your collection
  - Stream music in your browser

The application has been built for my 4th year degree project, the aim of which was to learn how to write applications using [Node.js].
